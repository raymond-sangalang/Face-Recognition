# Face-Recognition

Program:

        In the program, there are multiple files linked to opencv and harrasscascade, such that these files interact in               computing data collected in a local binary-pattern histogram as the graphs threshold; depicting  the key feautures 
        throughout shadows within the face. To include, python's library module Pillow allowed multiples files/Picture to 
        be opened and Pickle created in deserializing and serializing the collections of data inputed in the data structure.
  
  GUI- 
  
       importing tkinter from python's library and utilized as a front-end management of the program. Thus, playing a
       key role with the data structure and user checkbutton for starting recognition, adding user information, deleting 
       data and collecting multiple data pictures for comparison.
